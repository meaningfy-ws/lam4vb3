(03/05/2016): CDM-135: In the context of merger cases, the Commission decisions declaring a concentration to be compatible with the common market concern two or more parties (usually companies). See an example https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32017M8399 However, such values are currently stored as ‘Addressee’ (cdm:resource_legal_addresses_organization  ) but this is not correct because these companies are only the object of the Commission investigation, and not the addressee of the decision. Therefore, it is necessary to create a new property which would store the names of these companies. Once this is created, the CELLAR team will have to move all the values from 'Addressee' into the new property.
The label for the new property should be : 'Companies involved".

    skos:scopeNote """Documents should never be indexed by "root level" directory codes (ex: 20.00.00.00) but rather at a more specific level.

Documents may be indexed with up to three directory codes.

Users should be able to find, under each directory heading, all of the documents dealing specifically with the given subject without having to browse through subheadings or other headings. When the document deals with one special issue, indexing must then be done using the most specific descriptor fitting as properly as possible the topic covered by the document. If no existing heading specifically suits the document, it has to be filed under the closest more general entry.

As a consequence, the same document should never be indexed simultaneously using, within the same directory, a general heading and a more specific heading positioned hierarchically underneath it.

For example, the same document should bear one proper descriptor and not be labelled as such:
07.20.30.00 Transport policy / Inland transport / Market operation
07.20.30.30 Transport policy / Inland transport / Market operation / Transport prices and terms 

When a document deals with multiple topics related to several sub-headings of the same chapter, instead of indexing under one general entry, multiple headings should be chosen provided they all are of the same level. However, it is better to minimize the number of descriptors used to prevent that acts are published in several places in the directory.

For example, a text regarding both excise duties and individual tax exemptions should be analysed as such:
09.30.20. Taxation / Indirect taxation / Excise duties
09.30.40. Taxation / Indirect taxation / Individual tax exemptions

and not 09.30. Taxation / Indirect taxation

The classification of EUR-Lex documents with the Directory Codes will have to be performed in line with the ISO 5963 standard, completed with what the guidelines as stated in this document.

Basic rules

What is document classification?

Classification consists of assigning documents to one or more categories based on their main topics. When classifying, it must be kept in mind that it is not the content of the document that is being described (indexation) but the main subject(s) that the document covers (classification).

Basic principles of classification:

• Follow the three stages of classification:

     o Examination of the document (intellectual analysis).
     o Identification of the main topic(s) covered by the document.
     o Selection of the directory codes that correspond with the main topics previously identified.

• Be as specific as possible. Choose the directory code(s) which adjust better to the main topic(s).

• Do not classify a document with two directory codes (general and specific) belonging to the same hierarchical line. It is possible to use various codes under the same domain but it is not possible to use the main domain and one of its subdivisions. For example:

Correct: 03.20.30.00 Agriculture / Agricultural structural funds / European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development

• Keep the end-user in mind. The directory codes are employed by the user for document retrieval therefore it is important to select the directory codes which have a potential value for the users. If a document is not correctly classified the user will get irrelevant results in its query.

• Be careful with the "General" or "Miscellaneous" categories. These must be used only if no other subdivision is adequate for the classification of the document. An overuse of these categories leads to "noise" after a query (retrieval of numerous documents which are not relevant to the user).

Classification guidelines – How to assign directory codes:

The first directory code to be assigned will conform to the following instructions:

EU legislation must be based on an appropriate treaty provision which means that each institution must act within powers conferred by a treaty. 
The legal basis of EU legal acts are mentioned in the documents. The make reference to the provision which confers competence to adopt the act in question. 
Treaty provisions are grouped under Treaty titles, chapters, sections or in protocols. Since the Directory codes cover the EU activities and competences, a correspondence can be set up between the Treaty titles, chapters, etc and the subdivision of the Directory. 
It means that the legal basis can be used as solid information to classify the legal acts and for this a correspondence table between the articles of TEU and TFEU and the Directory Codes has been created.

If in the correspondence table there is a reference to one of the main domains in the Directory Codes (e.g. 01 General, financial and institutional matters) it means that, if possible, the classifier will have to choose the most specific subdivision within the main domain.
If in the correspondence table there is a reference to more than one directory code the classifier must choose the most specific subdivision form each chapter or from the most adequate chapter of the Directory. 

The subsequent directory codes (if any) will be assigned following the basic classification principles previously mentioned.
The legal basis of non-legislative acts makes reference to a basic act. In this case, the Treaty provision of this act has to be used for classification.
Preparatory documents don't have a legal basis, but usually there is mention to the legal basis of the proposed act which can be used for classification. 

The minimum number of directory codes that can be assigned to a document is one (1). There is no maximum number of directory codes that can be assigned to a document, but it is recommended not to use more than three (3).

    skos:historyNote """PART II:  Applying the general indexing principles: concrete rules and examples from the already indexed EUR-Lex documentary collection

1. Use EuroVoc for indexation and the Directory code and Subject headings for classification

While indexing with EuroVoc, indexer should keep in mind the different purpose and the use of an indexing tool and a classification tool.
The systematic use of general EuroVoc terms (most frequently top terms) can easily result in classifying the documents instead of indexing them, so their use should be limited to documents at very general level and only to documents that really speak about the selected general descriptor. 
This principle is in line with the principle that the most specific EuroVoc term should be used. Before assigning a general term (top term) to a document, indexer is asked to examine whether one of its specific term corresponds better to the content of the document.
Classifying instead of indexing may occur not only at top terms level but at specific level as well. To avoid this, indexer is always asked to verify before assigning a descriptor to a document whether the chosen descriptor really corresponds to the content of the document (indexation) or only classifies the document by referring to its main subject(s) (classification).

i) 32011D0302: Council implementing decision 2011/302/CFSP concerning restrictive measures against Syria
This document concerns in general the common foreign and security policy. In this case the descriptor CFSP was used to classify the document (see classification under the Directory code and Subject mater):

EUROVOC descriptor: 
international sanctions / human rights / CFSP / restriction of liberty

Directory code: 
18.00.00.00 Common Foreign and Security Policy 

Subject matter: 
Common foreign and security policy 

ii) 32011D0019(01): Decision of the European Central Bank of 15 November 2011 amending Decision ECB/2007/7 concerning the terms and conditions of TARGET2-ECB (ECB/2011/19)
This document concerns in general the European Monetary Union. In this case the descriptor Economic and Monetary Union was used to classify the document (see classification under the Directory code and Subject mater):

EUROVOC descriptor: 
Economic and Monetary Union / electronic banking / intra-Community payment 

Directory code: 
10.30.30.00 Economic and monetary policy and free movement of capital / Economic policy / Economic and monetary union 

Subject matter: 
Economic and Monetary Union, European Central Bank, Euro

2. Follow the three stages of indexing 

If the three intellectual stages of the indexation process are not respected, it may lead to some typical indexation errors and may negatively affect the performance of the query. 
These errors are the followings:

A. Missing descriptors 
If descriptors are missing, the query system will not retrieve the relevant documents answering to the users' query. There will be an information loss or 'silence' and desscriptor has to be added. 

Missing descriptors occurs due to imperfection:
• either in identification of the essential concepts with a potential value for the users during document analysis
• or in translation of these identified concepts into EuroVoc descriptors

If there is no descriptor in EuroVoc corresponding to the selected concept (neither at the same level of specificity, nor at the next higher level), indexer should try to represent the given concept by the combination of several existing descriptors.
If it is not possible, propositions can be sent to the OP by using the 'Contribute' menu of the EuroVoc website in order to include a new descriptor in EuroVoc.

i) 2011CN0414: Reference for a preliminary ruling from the Polimeles Protodikio Athinon (Greece) lodged on 8 August 2011
This document concerns questions, which should be clarified by the Court of Justice: "Under Article 27 of the TRIPS Agreement are chemical and pharmaceutical products patentable subject matter provided that they satisfy the requirements for the grant of patents and, if so, what is the scope of their protection?"

Descriptor TRIPS – the main descriptors which should be used to cover the subject of the document – was missing:

EUROVOC descriptor: 
European patent / patent law / chemical product / pharmaceutical product 

ii) 32011R1004: Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1004/2011 of 11 October 2011 amending the representative prices and additional import duties for certain products in the sugar sector fixed by Implementing Regulation (EU) No 971/2011 for the 2011/12 marketing year
One of the main descriptors ("representative price") was missing:

EUROVOC descriptor: 
Community import / raw sugar / CCT duties / beet sugar / cane sugar 

iii) 32011D0634: Council Decision of 17 May 2011 on the signing, on behalf of the European Union, and provisional application of the International Cocoa Agreement 2010
• One of the main descriptors ("signature of an agreement") was missing.
• If a document concerns an agreement, also the type and the field (EC trade agreement) of the agreement should be expressed by indexing terms – see also Annex III (Descriptors clarification), EC agreement.
 
EUROVOC descriptor: 
sustainable development(*) / economic growth(*)  / cocoa 
 (*) In this case too general descriptors were used. See point 2.3 (Be as specific as possible).

B. Incorrect descriptors 
If descriptors are incorrectly used (not relevant, out of context), the query system will retrieve several but irrelevant documents, there will be a 'noise'  In that case, incorrect descriptors have to be deleted. 

The use of incorrect descriptors is due to: 
• either the misunderstanding of the content of the document
• or to the defect in examining the contextual and semantic environment of the selected descriptor (non-preferred terms, related terms, hierarchy, notes) which may lead to the misunderstanding of the selected descriptor

Theoretically, the semantic environment of a descriptor helps to clarify the meaning of a descriptor, but if it is not the case, clarification and additional notes to a EuroVoc term can be demanded from the OP. 

i) 620091TA00118: Case T-118/09: Judgment of the General Court of 5 October 2011 — La Sonrisa de Carmen and Bloom Clothes v OHIM — Heldmann (BLOOMCLOTHES)

EUROVOC descriptor: 
real estate business / European trademark / registered trademark 

This document concerns the trademark law. The subject of commercial activity of the companies – parties to the action – is not specified in the text. Anyway, the name of the trademark in question (Blomclothes) could indicate the field of the business activity – clothing. For more information a more detailed searching is needed in this case (related documents, web sites of the companies etc.).

ii) 52011XC1011(04): Commission communication pursuant to Article 17(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules for the operation of air services in the Community

EUROVOC descriptor: 
public servi / invitatice / invitation to tender / inland transport / air transport /Greece

This document concerns an invitation to tender for providing service of general interest (air transport). The descriptor "public services" refers to "the body providing a service" (see SN). Descriptor "services of general interest" should be used in this case.

iii) 52011DC0666: Communication from the Commission to the European parliament and the Council: Enlargement Strategy and Main Challenges 2011-2012
 
EUROVOC descriptor: 
Albania / Community acquis / Turkey / ISPA / accession criteria / Macedonia

Macedonia is a region of Greece. This communication concerns the "Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia".

3. Be as specific as possible

According to the general indexing principle, the most specific EuroVoc term should be selected.
If a document is indexed at a higher/more general level than the level of specificity of the selected concept, it will generate ‘noises’ and user will get irrelevant results.

i) 32011D0739: Council Decision of 20 October 2011 on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union, the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein amending the Additional Agreement between the European Community, the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein extending to the Principality of Liechtenstein the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on trade in agricultural products

EUROVOC descriptor: 
Liechtenstein / foodstuff / EC agreement / designation of origin / Switzerland / agricultural product / ratification of an agreement

The more specific descriptor "EC trade agreement" should be used in this case. "EC agreement" and "EC trade agreement" belongs to the same hierarchical line. "EC trade agreement is the NT of 'EC agreement".

ii) 62006FB0105: Case F-105/06: Order of the Civil Service Tribunal (First Chamber) of 27 September 2011 — Lübking and Others v Commission
The case concerns: "Annulment of the Commission’s decision published in Administrative Notices No 85 2005 of 23 November 2005 in so far as it provided for promotion of the applicants to grade A*9 and not grade A*10 in the 2005 promotion exercise."

EUROVOC descriptor: 
equal treatment / appointment of staff / professional career / staff assessment / European official

The more specific descriptor "promotion" should be used in this case. "Professional career" and "promotion" belong to the same hierarchical line. "Promotion" is the NT of "Professional career". 

iii)32011R1136: Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1136/2011 of 9 November 2011 establishing the standard import values for determining the entry price of certain fruit and vegetables
 
EUROVOC descriptor: 
fruit / Community import / vegetable / import price / common organisation of markets 

Ephemeral documents usually contain (in their annexes) the concrete product names or the Combined Nomenclature (CN) codes of the products concerned by the act. Indexer is asked to use the most specific descriptor corresponding to the products and not only descriptors referring to the category of the concerned products. More specific descriptors (citrus fruit, grape, pip fruit and fruit vegetable) should be used in this case. 

If EuroVoc has no descriptor at the same level of specificity as the selected concept, the descriptor at the next higher level should be chosen: Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 388/2011 of 19 April 2011 concerning the authorisation of maduramicin ammonium alpha as a feed additive for chickens for fattening (holder of authorisation Alpharma (Belgium) BVBA) and amending Regulation (EC) No 2430/1999 Text with EEA relevance: Since EuroVoc has no descriptor for ‘maduramicin ammonium’ (which is an antibiotic), use the descriptor at the next higher level.
 
In some cases, specific terms are considered in EuroVoc as non-preferred terms of generic terms. (e.g. name of classes and their components – reptile NPT crocodile)

4. Simultaneous use of several descriptors belonging to the same hierarchical line

Before indexers select a Eurovoc term, they should navigate the content of the thesaurus and analyze the hierarchical relationships of the selected terms. It will alert them to the existence of a more or a less generic term belonging to the same hierarchical line: if both of them suits to the content of the document, the most specific one should be used.

i) 32011R0418: Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 418/2011 of 28 April 2011 amending the representative prices and additional import duties for certain products in the sugar sector fixed by Regulation (EU) No 867/2010 for the 2010/11 marketing year

EUROVOC descriptor: 
sugar product / syrup / representative price / CCT duties
Descriptors sugar product and syrup belong to the same hierarchical line. The most specific should be chosen.

ii) 62011CN0454: Reference for a preliminary ruling from the Latvijas Republikas Augstākās tiesas Senāta Adminsitratīvo (Republic of Latvia) lodged on 1 September 2011 — Gunārs Pusts v Lauku atbalsta dienests

EUROVOC descriptor: 
aid recipient / terms of aid / aid system  
Descriptors aid recipient and aid system belong to the same hierarchical line. The most specific should be chosen.

5. Prefer pre-coordinated descriptors to ‘simple’ descriptors or to the combination of two or more ‘simple’ descriptors

EuroVoc, originally built up specifically for processing the documentary collection of the EU institutions, contains a large number of pre-coordinated descriptors in the field of EU activities. These pre-coordinated descriptors (e.g. ‘import (EU)’) exist in parallel with ‘simple’ descriptors (e.g. ‘import’), either with a hierarchical relationship between them (same hierarchical line) or as related terms, belonging to different top terms or microthesauri.
Giving preference to the use of pre-coordinated EuroVoc descriptors is essential since it affects the performance of the query results.
In EUR-Lex, there are an important number of documents that requires pre-coordinated descriptors. If EuroVoc does not contain the necessary pre-coordinated descriptor, propositions can be sent to the OP via the Contribute menu of Euro.

Examples of pre-coordinated descriptors:
appointment of staff (in general, BT personnel administration). Do not use this descriptors for indexing a document about the appointments in EU institutions/bodies Ex: 32011D0243
appointment of members – pre-coordinated – use only for the appointments in EU institutions, bodies, agencies

budget financing – resources of a budget (national budget, budget of an organisation, etc.)
financing of the EU budget – pre-coordinated  – concerns the different types of resources of the EU (Where does the money come from? How is EU budget is financed?)
 
import Ex: 32011R0385
import (EU) pre-coordinated

export  Ex:  52011PC0245
export (EU) pre-coordinated

bilateral agreement – See SN – use for documents about agreement between two States Ex: 52011SC0640
EC agreement – pre-coordinated –  use for documents about agreement between the EU in one part + third country or (international) organisation in combination with the country name or the organisation's name. If possible, use specific pre-coordinated descriptors for the different types of EU agreements (European association agreement, association agreement (EU), cooperation agreement (EU), interim agreement (EU), trade agreement (EU), negotiation of an agreement (EU)) EX: 32011D0334

action programme – BT management (UF framework programme, plan of action, work programme) Do not use for EU programmes Ex: 52011AE0533
EU programme – pre-coordinated

6. Use geographical descriptors

Domain 72 Geograpy of EuroVoc contains geographical descriptors. Use descriptors of countries when a document concerns specifically one or more countries or examines a particular situation in a given country. For example:
• agreement with a country
• action against a State / judgment of a court concerning a country
• national statistics
• state aid regime of a country / authorization of State aid, etc.
• EU financing expenditure in a State
• origin of a product
• national law of a State
 
Group of countries / international organisations
If the document speaks about group of countries or international organisations as a whole, do not list the name of the member countries, but use only the descriptor concerning the group from the domain 76 International organisations. 
However, if needed, country names and descriptors referring to an organisation/group of country can be used simultaneously since they do not belong to the same hierarchical line and domain. 

52010XG0415(01): Notice for the attention of the persons, entities and bodies to which restrictive measures provided for in Council Decision 2011/239/CFSP apply

EUROVOC descriptor: 
international sanctions / economic sanctions / natural person  
A geographical descriptor is missing (Myanmar). Restrictive measures are provided against Burma/Myanmar. 

Regions
Only the names of regions of EU Member States are in EuroVoc, but not those of third countries. 
Use regions' names when a document is specifically about a region of an EU Member State. 
If needed, regions names can be used together with country names since they do not belong to the same hierarchical line. 

52010X0416(03): Summary information communicated by Member States on State aid granted 

EUROVOC descriptor: 
Italy / fishing industry / aid system / control of State aid / small and medium-sized enterprises / aquaculture / State aid 
A geographical descriptor is missing (Sardegne). State aid was granted by the 'Regione Autonoma della Sardegna'.

7. Physical entity of the document

Indexation of the EUR-Lex documentary collection with EuroVoc should not concern the type and/or the author of the document. This information are covered by other metadata, EuroVoc descriptors should be only used to index the content of the document.

Author
The use of ‘institutions’ descriptors (EU institutions, bodies, services, organisations, agencies and international organizations) should be limited to documents which are about:
• the functioning of an institution (rules of procedures, composition, appointment, etc.)
• the competencies of an institution
• the role of an institution
• the activity of an institution
• agreements, cooperation between institutions

Do not use ‘institutions’ descriptors of EuroVoc when the given institution or body is the author of the document and the document does not speak about its functioning, activity, etc.

52011SC0622): Commission staff working paper accompanying the report from the Commission to the European parliament and the Council

EUROVOC descriptor: 
Community financing / EC Commission / information  

Author: 
European Commission 

Descriptor EC Commission refers to the author of the document. This descriptor should be deleted.

Type of document/of act
EuroVoc descriptors belonging to the top term ‘document’ or to ‘EU act’ should not be used for identifying the type of document. Other field of metadata is available for that purpose.

52010XX1016(01): Opinion of the European Data Protection Supervisor on Promoting Trust in the Information Society by Fostering Data Protection and Privacy

EUROVOC descriptor: 
data processing / personal data / Community opinion / European data protection supervisor 

Form: 
Opinion 

Descriptor Community opinion refers to the type of the document. This descriptor should be deleted.

8. Achieve indexing consistency

Concerning the EUR-Lex documentary collection, the creation of flexible templates can be good solutions for achieving indexing consistency. The indexing terms in these templates may change according to the content of the document. 
Already defined templates are listed in the third part of the document.

    skos:scopeNote """Part I: General indexing principles – How to use a thesaurus as an indexing tool?

In order to meet the retrieval needs of the end-users of a documentary collection by using thesaurus indexing terms, a number of general indexing principles have to be respected. 

The basic principles of subject indexing are the followings:

(1) Index the content of the document

(2) Follow the three stages of indexing: 

• examination of the document
• identification of its main subject content
• selection of indexing terms that describe that content 

(3) Be as specific as possible

(4) Do not index simultaneously with two descriptors (specific and general) belonging to the same hierarchical line

(5) Prefer pre-coordinated descriptors to simple descriptors

(6) The indexer’s job is only to index, not to interpret, evaluate or diagnose

(7) Use geographical descriptors if possible

(8) Subject indexing should not concern the physical entity of the document

(9) Achieve indexing consistency

These basic indexing rules are also described by the international standard ISO 5963 document entitled Methods for examining documents, determining their subjects and selecting indexing terms. 

1. Index the content of the document: use thesaurus terms for document content indexation and not for classification 

The thesaurus is an indexing tool. Indexing consists of representing the content of the document with selected descriptors of a thesaurus in the purpose of document retrieval. 

Indexation does not consist of classifying documents according to their main subject(s) with a classification scheme or a subject heading list.

Indexation with thesaurus terms is often contrasted to classification with a classification scheme. Classification consists of assigning documents to one ore more categories based on their main topics. 

2. Follow the three stages of indexing 

Indexation is a complex, intellectual decision process including the following steps:

• 1.2.1 examining the document (intellectual analysis)

In order to be able to analyse the content of documents, indexer should have adequate knowledge of the field covered by the document. Indexer should understand the concepts and main ideas encountered in the document.

• 1.2.2 identifying the principal concepts and the essential elements of the document 

In order to be able to select the concepts which have a potential value for the users, indexer should know the purpose for which the indexing terms will be used (document retrieval).

• 1.2.3 expressing the selected concepts in thesaurus terms

In order to be able to represent the selected concepts with thesaurus terms, indexer should have adequate knowledge of the vocabulary he/she is using (structure, preferred terms and non-preferred terms, cross-relations, etc). 
Since the meaning of a descriptor is clarified by the thesaurus itself (by the relations of a term with other descriptors), indexer is asked to always examine the contextual and semantic environment of the descriptors:

• Domain 
• Microtheasurus
• USE/UF – preferred terms and non-preferred terms
• Top term and narrow terms
• Related terms
• Notes

3. Be as specific as possible 

When indexing, the most specific term available in the thesaurus should be selected to represent the given concept. It means that:

• the descriptor chosen to represent the selected concept of the document should be at the same level of specificity as the selected concept

• if the thesaurus has no descriptor at the same level of specificity as the selected concept, the descriptor at the next higher level should be chosen (descriptor which is closest to the concept)

Loss of specificity occurs when a particular concept of a document is represented by an indexing term with more general meaning while an indexing term at the same level of specificity is available in the thesaurus.

Exceptions

In some special cases, indexing at a more general level than the selected concept may be justified. For example:

• when very specific concepts occur only casually or in the fringe area of the document, but the main part of the document is at general level 
• when a (long) document covers a lot of specific area (all the specific EU policies or all countries, etc.) which can be summarized in one or more generic terms

4. Do not index simultaneously with several descriptors (specific and general) belonging to the same hierarchical line 

The reasons for not indexing simultaneously with two or more descriptors belonging to the same hierarchy are the followings:

• it avoids multiple, redundant indexing
• broader indexing terms are linked to the more specific ones by the hierarchical tree structure of the thesaurus – ascending and/or descending (auto)posting is possible
 (In EUR-Lex, if the user searches for a generic term, all the documents indexed with one  of its narrower terms will be found)

N.B.: Descriptors on the same hierarchical level and related terms can be used simultaneously. 

5. Prefer pre-coordinated descriptors to ‘simple’ descriptors or to the combination of two or more simple descriptors

Pre-coordinated descriptors have been created in order to be able to represent with only one descriptor a complex, compound concept, instead of being obliged to combine several simple descriptors. The use of pre-coordinated descriptors gives better results in document retrieval than the combination of descriptors.

If there is no pre-coordinated descriptor in a thesaurus which can represent the selected compound concept, indexer should try to express it through the combination of two or more simple descriptors. 

6. Use geographical descriptors 

If the geographical context of a document is clearly mentioned or a document deals specifically with a country, region or an international organization, use thesaurus geographical descriptors.  

7. Indexing should not concern the physical entity of the document 

Type of document, author or any other metadata which do not concern the content of the document should not be indexed with thesaurus terms. This information is covered by other metadata. 

8. Achieve indexing consistency 

Within a large indexing team, a centralized checking stage is recommended to be set up and the creation of flexible templates can be good solutions for achieving indexing consistency.

(OR. fr)

LIMITE
JUR 272
INST 279

OPINION OF THE LEGAL SERVICE(*)

* This document contains legal advice protected under Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC)
No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding
public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents, and not released
by the Council of the European Union to the public. The Council reserves all its rights in law
as regards any unauthorised publication.

Subject: Date of adoption of acts under the ordinary legislative procedure
- application of Article 13 of the Regulation on Committee Procedure (1)

1. The purpose of this opinion of the Legal Service is to clarify the determination of the date on
which acts are adopted under the ordinary legislative procedure.

2. This question has arisen in particular for acts which were adopted before the Committee
Procedure Regulation entered into force on 1 March 2011 and were signed by the Presidents
of the European Parliament and of the Council after that date. Insofar as those acts refer to the
old Decision on Committee Procedure (2), which was repealed on 1 March 2011 by the
Regulation on Committee Procedure, the question arises of the applicability of Article 13 of
the Regulation on Committee Procedure.

3. Under Article 294(4) TFEU, when the Council approves the position of the European
Parliament at first reading "the act concerned shall be adopted in the wording which
corresponds to the position of the European Parliament". The date of adoption of the act is
therefore that on which the Council approved the European Parliament's position.

4. At second reading, the act is deemed to be adopted when:
- within three months following the transmission of the first-reading position of the Council
to the European Parliament, the latter approves the Council’s position or has not taken a
decision (3); in that case, the date of adoption of the act should be considered to be that on
which the European Parliament approved the Council's position or the date when the
three-month period expired; or
- within three months following receipt of the European Parliament's amendments, the
Council approves all the European Parliament's amendments by a qualified majority (4 ); in
that case, the date of adoption of the act should be considered to be that on which the
Council approved the European Parliament's amendments.

5. At third reading, the act is adopted when, within a period of – in principle – six weeks
following the approval of a joint text by the Conciliation Committee, the European Parliament
and the Council adopt the act in question in accordance with that text(5). In that case, the date of
adoption of the act should be deemed to be the date when the act was adopted by the second
of the two institutions.

6. The signing of the act by the presidents of the two institutions, provided for in Article 297(1),
is distinct from the adoption of the act and its value consists solely in authentication of the
act (6). Therefore, even if the date of signing is included in the title of the act, as published in the
Official Journal, as the date of the act, it is not the same as the date of the act's adoption.

7. Furthermore, the Legal Service deems incorrect the practice of including the date of signing
of an act in its title, in that it can lead to confusion as to the date of the act's birth in the legal
system of the EU, despite the systematic inclusion in acts adopted by the ordinary legislative
procedure of a footnote specifying the dates on which the European Parliament and the
Council adopted their positions.

8. In conclusion, the Legal Service considers that it follows from Article 294 TFEU that the date
on which an act is adopted by the ordinary legislative procedure is the date of the decision of
the arm of the legislature that acts later (see paragraphs 3 to 5 above) and not the date of the
joint signing of the act by the presidents of the European Parliament and of the Council.
Article 13 of the Regulation on Committee Procedure therefore applies to acts adopted before
1 March 2011 but signed after that date.

(1) Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for
control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers (OJ L 55,
28.2.2011, p. 13).
(2) Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise
of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (OJ L 184, 17.7.1999, p. 23).
(3) Article 294(7)(a) TFEU.
(4) Article 294(8)(a) TFEU.
(5) Article 294 (13) TFEU.
(6) However, as the Court of Justice has already held, failure to sign an act is an infringement of
an essential procedural requirement of the act, which may, even automatically, entail the
annulment of the act concerned by the EU's courts (Judgment of 6 April 2000 in cases

Change of the methodology for ephemeral acts – EV not to be created.

29/06/2017: Information from SJ concerning validity of delegated/implementing acts
A delegated/implementing/comitology act does not automatically get repealed on the repeal of the basic legislative act on the basis of which it got adopted. An act is valid if its legal basis was valid at the time of adoption of the act. Such a delegated/implementing/comitology act would need to be specifically repealed by the Commission

15/03/2019: Association agreements – new Member States 
Notices covering the associationagreements with new MS  contain value 31/12/9999 in EV date. Therefore, the in force indicator says "In force".
We assume the EV date should be equal to the date of accession (minus 1 day); but this assumption has not been confirmed by any relevant authority.
Based on this, it was decided to remove EV field from such notices.
See https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/publications/jira/browse/LAAION-540

29/09/2016: GIL-GM Amended proposal – end of validity date of the initial proposal
Commission proposal can be amended a couple of times and that such amended proposals are published as separate notices on EUR-Lex. The questions is whether the end of validity date of the initial proposal can be understood as being the date of the adoption of the 1st amended proposal (minus 1 day) and whether the end of validity date of the 1st amended proposal can be understood as being the date of the adoption of the second amended proposal (minus 1 day)? Or should the first and second amended proposals be understood only as texts amending the initial proposal but not replacing it? The amended proposals can contain only the amendments or the amendments plus the original proposal, depending on the case-by-case basis. 
The participants agreed that both the initial proposal and the amended proposal(s) should keep having the fictional date of end of validity (implying that they are "pending"), until a final act is adopted. After this, the date of adoption of the final act becomes the date of end of validity of both the initial proposal and amended proposals. 

12/03/2019: GIL-GM Follow-up of Court's decisions on annulment (P/12032019/4a)
The legal analysis methodology does not follow up on the annulments of legal acts by judgments of the Court of Justice. Currently the date of end of validity of those acts remains indefinite; therefore, they remain marked as 'in force'.
The Commission Legal Service was consulted and considered that the effect should be as if it had never existed, therefore the value contained in the date of effect field should be reproduced in the date of end of validity, and the in force indicator switched to 'not in force'. The participants agreed on this solution and indicated that the comment 'declared void by' should be shown below the title, next to the in force indicator coloured point.
This solution should also be applied to cases where the judgment annuls the decision but orders to maintain the effects of the decision in force.

Example https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?qid=1571896291605&uri=CELEX:62011CJ0658: 

On those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby
   
1. Annuls Council Decision 2011/640/CFSP of 12 July 2011 on the signing and conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Mauritius on the conditions of transfer of suspected pirates and associated seized property from the European Union-led naval force to the Republic of Mauritius and on the conditions of suspected pirates after transfer;

12/03/2019: GIL-GM End of validity of international agreements when the decision on the signing was declared void by CdJ (P/12032019/4b)
The OP raised the question on how to proceed when the Court annuls the decision on the signing of an agreement. The participants agreed that in both decision and agreement cases the value corresponding to the date of entry into force should be set in the date of end of validity field.

    skos:historyNote """Acts repealed by a subsequent act – End of validity date of repealed acts 

• Acts repealed by acts which should be notified
An act is repealed by another act whose legal value depends of the date of notification.
If the notification date is not yet known, the end of validity date of the repealed act should have the following value, accompanied by the comment “repealed by” and the mention of the repealing act:

Date of document: 12/12/2013 
Date of effect: 08/01/2014; Entry into force Date pub. +20 See Art 2 
End of validity date: 31/12/9999 ; Repealed by 32011D0395

That date is to be modified once the notification date of the amending act is known and implemented in its notice.

• Acts declared null and void by a corrigendum
In such cases, the end of validity date is equal to the date of publication of the first act (and not to the date of the corrigendum).

Such formation must be completed by the creation of an active relation corrigendum → corrected act (for the comment to be added, see Relations).

Example 32013R1363, published in OJ L 343 of 19.12.2013 (before the corrigendum was published):
Date of document: 12/12/2013
Date of effect: 08/01/2014; Entry into force Date pub. +20 See Art 2 
End of validity date: 31/12/9999 

Document 32013R1363R(01) (corrigendum published in OJ L 343 of 20 December 2013) declares the  publication of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1363/2013 to be considered null and void.

Document 32013R1363 (after the corrigendum 32013R1363R(01) was published):

End of validity date: 19/12/2013 See 32013R1363R(01) 

Implicitly repealed amending acts

Basic act:   Any act from sector 2, 3, 4 or 5 which has subsequently been modified.

Amending act:  Any act which fully or partially modifies the basic act to which it relates. An amending act can be composed either of provisions which only relate to one basic act ("not-autonomous provisions") or of provisions which relate to more than one or to none basic act, and which produce a legal effect of their own (“autonomous provisions”).

An amending act is deemed implicitly repealed when the basic act to which it relates is repealed and does not explicitly mention that its successive amendments are also repealed, as long as the amending does not contain any autonomous provisions.

The end of validity date of the amending act should be the same as the one of the repealed basic act.

The information must be completed by the creation of an active relation act repealing the basic act → amending act (for implicitly repeals, see Relations).

Anti-dumping measures

A definitive anti-dumping measure shall expire five years from its imposition or five years from the date of conclusion of the most recent review (Council regulation (EC) No 1225/2009, art. 11.2).

There are two basic scenarios for the amendments concerning the end of validity date of an implementing measure:

Scenario 1

Publication of: Basic implementing regulation imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty
Date of application = 01-01-2014
End of validity date = 31-12-2018

Publication of: Implementing regulation amending the basic regulation (not repealing or amending the validity)
Date of application = DD-MM-YYYY
End of validity date = 31-12-2018

Publication of: Notice of the impending expiry of certain anti-dumping measures
(Published in OJ before the expiry of the basic regulation.)
No change needed for the end of validity of the basic implementing regulation or the amending regulation.

Scenario 2 (the dates in EV date are to be used successively, following the sequence of events described below)

Publication of: Basic implementing regulation imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty
Date of application = 01-01-2014
End of validity date = 31-12-2018 

Publication of: Implementing regulation amending the basic regulation (repealing or amending the validity, in this case to 31-12-2019)
Date of application = DD-MM-YYYY
End of validity date = 31-12-2019  + change of the end of validity date of the basic implementing regulation to be done 

Publication of: Notice of initiation of partial interim review of the anti-dumping measures
The basic implementing regulation should remain in force pending of the outcome of the review:
The end of validity date of the basic and amending implementing regulations has to be changed, until the review is published (should be changed to 31-12-9999)

Publication of:  New basic implementing regulation imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty
Date of application = 01-04-2020
End of validity date = 31-03-2025
The end of validity date of the basic (A) and amending implementing (B) regulations has to be changed to the definitive date (31-03-2020 – date of application of the new basic regulation minus one day)."""@en ;

    skos:scopeNote """These are the possible cases according to the nature of particular acts: 

(a) Acts of limited duration: The date of end of validity mentioned in the act. If the act has a specific expiration date, the end of validity date is followed by the comment See article where the date is specified):

End of validity date: 30/11/2008; See Art. 9

(b) Acts of unlimited duration: Fictional date 9999-12-31

(c) Repealed acts: The current end of validity date of the repealed act has to be changed as follows: 

End of validity date of the repealed act = date of effect of the repealing act (or date of its application if it is different as the date of entry into force ) minus 1 day. 

The end of validity date is followed by the comment Repealed by and the Celex identifier of the repealing act. The information is completed by creation of the relation repealing act → repealed act:

End of validity date: 26/01/2013; Repealed by 32013R0075 

(d) Extention of the validity: If the end of validity of an act has been extended by a subsequent act, the end of the validity date of the amended act has to be changed accordingly. Comment Ext. valid. by  and the Celex identifier of the amending act has to be added:

End of validity date: 30/09/2014; Ext. valid. by 32013D0468 

(e) Acts only repealing (or extending validity of) an earlier act and not containing any other autonomous provisions die in the same day as the repealed act.

(f) Acts repealed by acts which should be notified, acts declared null and void by a corrigendum and implicitly repealed amending acts (detailed methodology is explained in Exceptions and special cases).

There is no impact to the end of validity date if only a part of the act is repealed by a subsequent act (partial repeal).

(g) Acts that by their nature have no end of validity: Fictional date 9999-12-31.

(h) Legislative proposals (drafts, MS initiatives, drafts of general/amending budgets…): 

Fictional date 9999-12-31, to be changed into a factual date when the proposal is adopted (date of adoption of the pursuant legislative act); withdrawn (date of the document stating the withdrawal); rejected (date when the proposal was rejected) or replaced (date of adoption of the amended proposal).

(i) Acts listed as obsolete in documents from sector 5: Date of validity of obsolete acts = sector 5 document publication date.

Example (32002R1429 – listed in 52011XC1108(01))
Date of document: 02/08/2002
Date of effect: 01/07/2002; Implementation See Art 7
Date of effect: 06/08/2002; Entry into force Date pub. +3 See Art 7
End of validity date: 08/11/2011; Obsolete See 52011XC1108(01) P 1

(j) Acts related to the budget and to the specific financial year: Such acts have only limited duration (until the end of the relevant financial year).

Example 32011B0840 
Date of document: 28/10/2011
Date of effect: 01/01/2011; Entry into force Financial year 2011 
End of validity date: 31/12/2011; Financial year 2011 

(k) Acts related to the common agricultural policy or fisheries and to the specific marketing year: Such acts have only limited duration (until the end of the relevant marketing year; Definition of the marketing year could be find in article 6 of 32013R1308).
The same rule and comment should be applied for all acts referring to the specific fishing season (31972R2825).

Article 1
Quota exhaustion
The fishing quota allocated to the Member State referred to in the Annex to this Regulation for the stock referred to therein for 2016 shall be deemed to be exhausted from the date set out in that Annex.

Date of document: 15/12/2016; Date of adoption
Date of effect: 23/12/2016; Entry into force Date pub. +1 See Art 3
End of validity date: 31/12/2016; Period of reference 2016 (comment + year)

If it is not possible to determinate the exact dates of the marketing/fishing year and if the application of the act is not directly related to the marketing/fishing year, the end of validity should be a fictional date 9999-12-31.

(l) Ephemeral acts (acts related to day-to-day management of agricultural measures whose titles are printed in light type in OJ cover page): Such acts are generally valid only for a limited period and are automatically repealed by subsequent acts.
For such acts, EV field should not be created.

There is no in force indicator for ephemeral acts.

(m) Regulations opening an invitation to tender for specific agricultural products: End of validity date is usually mentioned in the provisions (The invitation should be open until DD/MM/YYYY).

(n) Acts concerning the appointments of members for a defined period: End of validity date is equal to the last day of the period mentioned in the provisions.

Example 32014D0047
Date of document: 28/01/2014 
Date of effect: 28/01/2014; Entry into force Date of document See Art 2
End of validity date: 25/01/2015; End of term of office See Art. 1 

(o) Anti-dumping measures (explained below in Exceptions and special cases)

(p) Documents from sector 5: End of validity date is mainly applicable to proposals, drafts, MS initiatives (see point (d) above) or ECB recommendations. 

For different documents from the decision-making process other than proposals, the EV date is applicable only for exceptional cases (e.g. EP legislative resolution repealing/replacing the previous one; no examples in the database)."""@en .

Entry into force vs Taking effect
General rules for the date of effect are indicated in article 297 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (twentieth day following the day of publication).

Article 297
(ex Article 254 TEC)

1. Legislative acts adopted under the ordinary legislative procedure shall be signed by the President of the European Parliament and by the President of the Council.

Legislative acts adopted under a special legislative procedure shall be signed by the President of the institution which adopted them.

Legislative acts shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union. They shall enter into force on the date specified in them or, in the absence thereof, on the twentieth day following that of their publication.

2. Non-legislative acts adopted in the form of regulations, directives or decisions, when the latter do not specify to whom they are addressed, shall be signed by the President of the institution which adopted them.

Regulations and directives which are addressed to all Member States, as well as decisions which do not specify to whom they are addressed, shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union. They shall enter into force on the date specified in them or, in the absence thereof, on the twentieth day following that of their publication.

Other directives, and decisions which specify to whom they are addressed, shall be notified to those to whom they are addressed and shall take effect upon such notification.

Please note differences between acts entering into force and acts taking effect (based on the provisions of TFEU article 297 quoted above).

I. Legislative acts – TFEU article 297(1): enter into force
-     ordinary legislative procedure
-     special legislative procedure
Display on EUR-Lex: Date of effect: dd/mm/yyyy; Entry into force

II.                Non-legislative acts – TFEU article 297(2):
1.	Regulations: enter into force

2.	Directives:
(a)    Directives addressed to all Member States: enter into force
(b)   Other directives: take effect (+ Date of effect (IF) is linked to the Date of notification (NF))

3.	Decisions:
(a)    Decisions which do not specify to whom they are addressed: enter into force
(b)   Decisions which do specify to whom they are addressed (incl those addresed to all Member States): take effect (+ Date of effect (IF) is linked to the Date of notification (NF))

Date of effect: dd/mm/yyyy; Entry into force

Display on EUR-Lex – cases 2(b) and 3(b):
Date of effect: dd/mm/yyyy; Takes effect

Note: Some non-legislative Council acts (decisions or directives which specify to whom they are addressed; but also Decisions of representatives of the governments of the Member States or recommendations) may contain a date of notification not linked to the date of enter into force/date of effect (which is indicated in the act). In this case the Date of notification (NF) will be created after receiving it from the relevant service. The Date of effect (IF) field (with the annotation Entry into force (e.g. 32015D2358) or Takes effect (e.g. 32015D0954), according to the text) will not be impacted by this change (for more details see Date of effect (IF)).

Entry into force vs Application
Please note also differences between enter into force and application. See the example below.

Text of the regulation: 

Article 5

This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.

It shall apply from 1 April 2015.

Information displayed on the EUR-Lex:

Date of effect: 04/02/2015; Entry into force Date pub. +20 See Art 5 
Date of effect: 01/04/2015; Application See Art 5 

Date of effect and date of notification
If the date of effect is not known and depends on the date of notification, insert 01-01-1001 + Takes effect + Date of notification:

Date of document: 14/08/2014
Date of effect: 01/01/1001; Takes effect Date notif. 

If acts with date of effect which is not yet known amends other acts (MS relation to be created), annotation start_of_validity to this relation should also contain the fictional date 01-01-1001. This will be changed to a real date together with IF date. 

Special cases
a) In some special cases, the date of effect can be earlier as the date of document (retroactive effect).

b) The "date of effect" field of an agreement with a third country that has been adopted by a regulation (and published together with this regulation in OJ) will show the same date as that of the adopting regulation.

c) Acts only repealing another act – they are usually effective as indicated in the relevant article and die in the same day as the repealed act.

Dear Mr Brkic, 

I have had your email below forwarded from the EFTA Secretariat. My apologies for getting back to you so late. 

Indeed, you may assume that any decisions in the field of State Aid or Competition, which are addressed to a specific addressee, be that a State or (a) private party/ies, apply as from the date of adoption. As a rule, we always notify such decisions to the addressee(s) on the date of adoption. If, exceptionally, we should fail to do so, we will notify the EFTA Secretariat of the notification date. 

I hope this answers your question. 

Kind regards, 

Gjermund Mathisen

8.3. The title of an act amending earlier acts is a special case. The title is incomplete unless it refers by number to all the acts amended. Without such a reference, it is not possible to find all the amendments to a given act. If the sole purpose of the act in question is to amend another act, either the sequential reference number and title of the act to be amended or its sequential reference number and the specific purpose of the amendment is mentioned (see points 18.9 and 18.10). In contrast, if the act in question lays down autonomous provisions and consequently amends another act in a purely subsidiary manner, only the number of that act is given (see point 19.3).

19. An act not primarily intended to amend another act may set out, at the end, amendments of other acts which are a consequence of changes which it introduces. Where the consequential amendments are substantial, a separate amending act should be adopted.

19.1. Sometimes an act with autonomous provisions alters the legal context of a given field to such an extent that other acts governing other areas within the same field need to be amended. To the extent that the amendment is only secondary to the main scope of the act, the juxtaposition of autonomous and amending provisions in the same act does not fall within the prohibition set out in Guideline 18 on the inclusion of autonomous substantive provisions in amending acts.
In order for the amendment to be apparent, it must be mentioned in the title of the act, by stating the sequential reference number of the act to be amended (see point 8.3).
Example:
Council Directive 92/96/EEC of 10 November 1992 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to direct life assurance and amending Directives 79/267/EEC and 90/619/EEC"""@en ;
