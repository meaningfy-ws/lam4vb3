\section{Introduction}\label{ariaid-title1}


The initiative for modeling the Legal Analysis Methodology (LAM) involves, among other things, a transformation step in which the LAM data represented in an Excel format is transformed into RDF format instantiating the LAM-SKOS-AP application profile. 

This document explains the structure of the Excel workbook serving as input data for the transformation script. We recommend that the reader is already be familiar with the context of LAM project and the general approach presented in Deliverable WP1.1\footnote{Costetchi E., 2019, Preliminary requirements specification for the Legal Analysis Methodology models}.
