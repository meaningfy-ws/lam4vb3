\section{Application profile}\label{ariaid-title11}

This section presents the application profile describing each class and data type. 
The class descriptions also comprise a list of relevant properties and the configuration in which they may appear in the data.

\subsection{lam:DocumentProperty}

This class aims to describe the properties that are used for describing legal documents. It aims at capturing the rules and constraints on permitted annotations and controlled lists of values.
This is a proxy class for the formal properties. It is aimed at capturing the human understandable definition and partially the formal constraints imposed on this property.

\textbf{Superclasses:}

\subsection{lam:LegalDocumentClass}

This class aims to describe legal documents that have a set of common features. It aims at capturing the rules and constraints on legal document properties, metadata elements, and cardinality.

\subsection{skos:ConceptScheme}

A SKOS concept scheme can be viewed as an aggregation of one or more
SKOS concepts. Semantic relationships (links) between those concepts may
also be viewed as part of a concept scheme. This definition is, however,
meant to be suggestive rather than restrictive, and there is some
flexibility in the formal data model stated below.

Thesauri, classification schemes, subject heading lists, taxonomies,
`folksonomies', and other types of controlled vocabulary are all
examples of concept schemes. Concept schemes are also embedded in
glossaries and terminologies.

		skos:prefLabel & rdfs:Literal & 1..1 & The preferred lexical label for a

		scheme may have the same preferred label in a given language.
		\\\addlinespace
		\bottomrule
		\addlinespace
		\caption{Properties of the skos:ConceptScheme class}
	\end{longtable}
}

\subsection{skos:Concept}

A SKOS concept can be viewed as an idea or notion; a unit of thought.
However, what constitutes a unit of thought is subjective, and this
definition is meant to be suggestive, rather than restrictive.

The notion of a SKOS concept is useful when describing the conceptual or
intellectual structure of a knowledge organization system, and when
referring to specific ideas or meanings established within a KOS.

Note that, because SKOS is designed to be a vehicle for representing
semi-formal KOS, such as thesauri and classification schemes, a certain
amount of flexibility has been built in to the formal definition of this
class.

\subsection{skos:Collection}

A meaningful collection of concepts. Labeled collections can be used
with collectible semantic relation properties i.e. skos:narrower, where
you would like a set of concepts to be displayed under a ``node label'' in
the hierarchy.

\subsection{rdfs:Resource}

All things described by RDF are called resources, and are instances of
the class rdfs:Resource. This is the class of everything.

\subsection{sh:PropertyShape}

A property shape is a shape in the shapes graph that is the subject of a
triple that has sh:path as its predicate. A shape has at most one value
for sh:path. Each value of sh:path in a shape must be a well-formed
SHACL property path. 

In LAM-SKOS-AP the role of sh:path is taken by lam:path.

		sh:maxCount specifies the maximum number of value nodes that satisfy the
		condition.
		\\\addlinespace
		sh:minCount & xsd:int & 0..1 & Minimum cardinality constraint. Formally
		sh:minCount specifies the minimum number of value nodes that satisfy the
		condition. If the minimum cardinality value is 0 then this constraint is
		always satisfied and so may be omitted.
		\\\addlinespace
		sh:name & rdfs:Literal & 1..1 & Property shapes may have one or more
		values for sh:name to provide human-readable labels for the property in
		the target where it appears.
		\\\addlinespace

\subsection{euvoc:XlNotation}

A notation is a string of characters used to uniquely identify a concept
within a specified context.

Like the skosxl:Label class reifies SKOS label statements, XlNotation
reifies SKOS notation statements. This class permits, if needed, to
maintain the historical view of the values and add additional provenance
descriptions.

\subsection{euvoc:XlNote}

reifies SKOS note statements (i.e. skos:editorialNote, skos:example,
skos:historyNote, skos:definition, skos:scopeNote and skos:changeNote).
This class permits, if needed, to maintain the historical view of the
values and add additional provenance descriptions.

\subsection{rdfs:Literal}

The class rdfs:Literal is the class of literal values such as strings
and integers. Property values such as textual strings are examples of
RDF literals.

\subsection{xsd:boolean}

The boolean data type is used to specify a true or false value.

\subsection{xsd:date}

The date data type is used to specify a date. The date is specified in
the following form ``YYYY-MM-DD'' where:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  YYYY indicates the year
\item
  MM indicates the month
\item
  DD indicates the day
\end{itemize}

Note: All components are required!

\subsection{xsd:int}
